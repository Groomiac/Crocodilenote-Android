# CrocodileNote for Android

A simple note-taking app. Create text notes and organize them into folders quickly and easily. All notes inside a folder are conveniently shown together, like slips of paper.

### Encryption

CrocodileNote can be used in one of two modes - plain or encryption. In the latter, all data is encrypted using password-based encryption (PKCS#5) with AES-256. These are common industry standards and are used by, for instance, the famous TrueCrypt disk encryption software.

In the plain mode you can view and copy folders to PC directly from your internal SD card. Use encryption if you want to protect your data and your privacy!

### Other features

- **Backup:** export all notes to ZIP
- **Linkify:** display notes with clickable links - useful if you store e-mail addresses, URLs or phone numbers
- **Auto-logout:** option to automatically log out after 30 minutes of inactivity (encryption mode only)
